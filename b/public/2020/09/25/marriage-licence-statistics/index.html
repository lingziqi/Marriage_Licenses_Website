<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>There are thousands of couples are getting married each day in the world. We are curious about how many marriage licenses are issued daily in Toronto. This paper, we explore the number of marriage licences which are issued each week with the collected data from the January of 2011 to the August of 2020. In our table, the data is collected every week of the month. The data provider divides one month into four weeks. Thus, we have four collected data for one month. Through table and graph, we find that 1117 is the highest number of marriage licenses issued in one week whereas 47 is the lowest number of marriage licenses issued in one week.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Marriage is one of the significant incidents happened for everyone. People are suggested to choose their future husband/wife cautiously and wisely. Marriage is one of many traditions that is kept from the ancient times. Although divorce rate starts to become a popular topic nowadays, marriage rate is still high relative to divorce rate. We often talk about marriage rate, but we know little about how many couples get married each week specifically. The curiosity to take a look into the number of marriage licenses are issued lead me to analyze this datatset.</p>
<p>We compare the number of marriage is licensed each week to learn about which week of the year has the most marriage licence issued. We extract, summarize the datatset. We made a histogram of the frequency of number of marriage licences are issued in a week. We analyze the graph and make several conclusion.</p>
<p>This paper, we are going to discuss the data as well as the graph. In terms of data, we will describe the marriage licenses in Toronto with numerical data. After we make a graph, we will analyze the data with graph’s skewness and graph information. At the end, we will discuss the weakness of this analysis and what we can make up for.</p>

<p>#Graph Discussion</p>
<p>It is a right-skewed histogram. The histogram is graph with number of marriage licenses as x variable. The y-axis is about the number of times of which the number of issued marriage licenses is the same throughout our time period. There are approximately 370 times if the number of issued marriage licenses is 0-400.</p>
<p>#Weakness</p>
<p>In our analysis, we can extract the approximate numbers of people getting married in a week but we are unable to clearly know the number since the histogram condense the number on the y-axis. In the future, we need to make more detail graph that shows the number with smaller gaps.</p>
